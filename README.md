#Gantt-Template

This is a template for a Gantt chart. It has the ability to keep track of all projects on a weekly basis.

As of now, this template is set up to keep track of projects for two years. New tasks can be added by copying 
and pasting an existing line. If you need to add more dates, that also can be copied and pasted.

The icon feature that notes the end of a task can be changed in row A. You can determine which projects are 
overall projects, and sub-projects. When a task is completed, the progress bar is greyed out, but still visible.

Once a few overall projects have been completed, it is recommended that you hide completed tasks. If too many 
tasks are completed, it is recommended that you start a new Gantt chart and copy over your uncompleted tasks.

To best compare an overall project with a sub-project, you may want to think about freezing panes. Column J is 
the best line to freeze horizontally. Vertically, just freeze the line you want to compare.
